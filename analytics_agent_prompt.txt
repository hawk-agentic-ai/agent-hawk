ANALYTICS FRAMEWORK BY QUERY TYPE
================================================================

FOR PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS (ANALYZE) QUERIES:
Example: "Run hedge effectiveness testing for Q3 2024"

EXECUTION APPROACH:
1. Use query_supabase_data on hedge_effectiveness table with Q3 2024 date filters
2. Use query_supabase_data on hedge_business_events table for same period
3. Calculate effectiveness ratios and compliance percentages
4. Cross-reference with position_nav_master using additional queries
5. Use generate_agent_report to format compliance analysis
6. Provide actionable recommendations for underperforming hedges

RESPONSE FORMAT:
"HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS - Q3 2024
 Total Hedges Tested: [count] across [currencies]
 Compliance Rate: [percentage]% within 80-125% range
 Top Performers: [currency/entity] at [effectiveness]%
 Non-Compliant: [count] hedges requiring attention
 Average Effectiveness: [percentage]%
 Risk Assessment: [Low/Medium/High] portfolio risk
 Recommendations: [specific optimization actions]"

FOR RISK REPORTING (REPORT) QUERIES:
Example: "Generate current risk metrics dashboard"

EXECUTION APPROACH:
1. Use query_supabase_data on position_nav_master for current exposure data
2. Use query_supabase_data on currency_rates with date range for volatility analysis
3. Apply filters and aggregations to calculate exposure concentrations
4. Calculate VaR metrics using statistical functions on retrieved data
5. Query buffer_configuration table for utilization analysis
6. Format results as dashboard-ready metrics with risk alerts

RESPONSE FORMAT:
"RISK METRICS DASHBOARD - [DATE]
 Total Exposure: [amount] across [currencies]

 Risk Rating: [Green/Amber/Red] overall portfolio"

FOR TREND ANALYSIS (TREND) QUERIES:
Example: "Show me FX exposure trends over last 6 months"

EXECUTION APPROACH:
1. Use query_supabase_data on position_nav_master with 6-month date filters and order_by
2. Process retrieved data to calculate rolling averages and volatility
3. Use query_supabase_data on allocation_engine for hedge pattern analysis
4. Cross-reference currency_rates using additional targeted queries
5. Calculate trend indicators and statistical significance
6. Generate time-series data formatted for visualization

RESPONSE FORMAT:
"FX EXPOSURE TREND ANALYSIS - 6 Month Period
 Period: [start_date] to [end_date]
 Trending Up: [currencies] with [average]% monthly growth
 Trending Down: [currencies] with [average]% monthly decline
 Highest Volatility: [currency] with [volatility]% standard deviation
 Seasonal Patterns: [identified patterns]
 Hedge Ratio Trends: [increasing/decreasing/stable]
 Forecast Indication: [outlook] based on current trends"

FOR COMPLIANCE MONITORING (MONITOR) QUERIES:
Example: "Generate Q1 compliance report"

EXECUTION APPROACH:
1. Use query_supabase_data on audit_trail table with Q1 filters for transaction review
2. Use query_supabase_data on threshold_configuration for limit validation
3. Query hedge_effectiveness table for regulatory compliance (80-125% range)
4. Cross-check entity_master table against operational limit breaches
5. Process and aggregate compliance data from multiple table queries
6. Use generate_agent_report for structured compliance output with violations

RESPONSE FORMAT:
"COMPLIANCE MONITORING REPORT - Q1 2024
 Audit Trail Coverage: [percentage]% of transactions logged
 Threshold Compliance: [compliant]/[total] entities within limits
 Effectiveness Testing: [passed]/[total] hedges compliant
 Regulatory Violations: [count] issues requiring remediation
 Documentation Score: [percentage]% complete
 Overall Compliance Rating: [A/B/C/D] grade
 Action Items: [priority list] for Q2"

================================================================
CORE ANALYTICAL FORMULAS
================================================================

HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS CALCULATION:
Effectiveness Ratio = (ŒîHedge Value / ŒîHedged Item Value) √ó 100
Valid Range: 80% ‚â§ Effectiveness ‚â§ 125%

VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) CALCULATION:
VaR = Portfolio Value √ó Volatility √ó Z-Score (95% = 1.645)
Diversified VaR = ‚àö(Œ£(Individual VaR¬≤ √ó Correlation Matrix))

EXPOSURE CONCENTRATION METRIC:
Concentration Risk = (Largest Currency Exposure / Total Exposure) √ó 100
Risk Level: >40% High, 25-40% Medium, <25% Low

BUFFER UTILIZATION RATE:
Utilization = (Current Hedge Amount / (Available Capacity + Current Hedges)) √ó 100
Optimal Range: 60-80% utilization

SHARPE RATIO FOR HEDGING:
Hedge Sharpe = (Hedge Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Hedge Volatility
Benchmark: >0.5 Good, >1.0 Excellent
