# Agent Mode Streaming Fix

## Issues Identified from Console Logs:

### 1. Database Schema Constraint Error ❌
```
"value too long for type character varying(10)"
```
**Problem**: `instruction_id` field limited to 10 characters, but generated IDs were longer
**Fix**: Changed `generateInstructionId()` to generate short IDs like `I1`, `I2`, etc.

### 2. Backend Credit Limit Reached ❌
```
"Your team baa4f892-7204-424c-b33d-58e54f82212b has either used all available credits or reached its monthly spending limit"
```
**Problem**: Dify backend out of credits
**Status**: This needs to be resolved on the backend/Dify side

### 3. JSON Parsing Errors ❌
```
"Unterminated string in JSON at position 397"
"Unexpected token ',', ",\"error"... is not valid JSON"
```
**Problem**: Streaming responses were split across chunks, breaking JSON parsing
**Fix**: 
- Added proper buffering for incomplete lines
- Refactored line processing into separate method
- Added error handling for malformed JSON

## Code Changes Made:

### 1. Fixed Instruction ID Generation
```typescript
private generateInstructionId(): string {
  // Keep instruction_id short to fit character varying(10) constraint
  return `I${this.instructionIdCounter++}`;
}
```

### 2. Improved Stream Processing
```typescript
// Added proper buffering
let buffer = ''; // Buffer for incomplete lines

// Process complete lines only
const lines = buffer.split('\n');
buffer = lines.pop() || ''; // Keep incomplete line in buffer
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
```typescript
// Handle error responses from backend
if (data.event === 'error') {
  console.error('❌ Backend error received:', data.message || data.error);
  throw new Error(`Backend error: ${data.message || data.error || 'Unknown error'}`);
}
```

### 4. Better Graceful Fallbacks
- Conversations table errors now show warnings instead of breaking the app
- Database save failures don't block chat functionality
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Current Status:

✅ **Fixed**: Database schema constraint errors
✅ **Fixed**: JSON parsing issues in streaming
✅ **Fixed**: Graceful handling of missing conversations table
❌ **Backend Issue**: Credit limit reached - needs backend/Dify resolution

## Next Steps:

1. **Test the fixes** - Try agent mode again and check console
2. **Backend credits** - Need to resolve Dify credit limit issue
3. **Database schema** - Consider updating `instruction_id` field to allow longer values if needed

## Expected Behavior After Fixes:

- Agent mode should handle streaming properly (when backend has credits)
- Database errors won't break the chat functionality
- JSON parsing errors should be eliminated
- Better error messages for debugging
